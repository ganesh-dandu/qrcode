   <h2>  I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned<br/> were current, if not more so, 
    in the company I joined. I <br/>honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</h2>
    <h5>  “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a <br/>
      transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
      for<br/> the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
      The next 12 weeks<br> was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
      the course, I’ve<br> successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</h5>

         <h2> Such a life-changing <br/>experience. Highly<br/> recommended!</h2>
          <h4>   “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve<br/> never written a line of code. I needed<br/> some structure from 
            professionals <br/>who can help me learn programming<br/> step by step. I was encouraged to <br/>enroll by a former 
            student of theirs<br/> who can only say wonderful things<br/> about the program. The entire <br/>curriculum and staff 
            did not<br/> disappoint. They were very hands-on<br/> and I never had to wait long for<br/> assistance. The agile team 
            project, in<br/> particular, was outstanding. It took<br/> my learning to the next level in a way <br/>that no tutorial 
            could ever have. In<br/> fact, I’ve often referred to it during<br/> interviews as an example of my <br/>developent 
            experience. It certainly<br/> helped me land a job as a full-stack<br/> developer after receiving multiple <br/>offers. 
            100% recommend! ”</h4>
